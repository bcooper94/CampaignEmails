[22:23] <space-bot> Hello. Have you come to lend your support to my campaign?
[22:23] <@me> space-bot: Hello. No
[22:23] <space-bot> Do you think that we care well enough about our veterans?
[22:23] <@me> space-bot: Nope
[22:24] <@me> space-bot: Do you think we care about our veterans?
[22:24] <space-bot> Well, I'm glad you mentioned that. I want to ensure that our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support they earned with their service to our country.
[22:24] <space-bot> Well, I'm afraid I need to go. Don't forget to vote in the upcoming election!

[22:42] <space-bot> Hey, do you wanna make America great again?
[22:42] <@blarg> space-bot: Hello. Sure, why not
[22:43] <space-bot> So you're going to vote for me, right?
[22:43] <@blarg> space-bot: No
[22:44] <@blarg> space-bot: How do you think we can repair our crumbling infrastructure?
[22:44] <space-bot> Well, I'm glad you mentioned that. I’m going to put American steel made by American workers into the backbone of America’s infrastructure.I will implement a bold, visionary plan for a cost-effective system of roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, railroads, ports and waterways, and pipelines in the proud tradition of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed the interstate highway system.
[22:44] <space-bot> Well, I'm afraid I need to go. Don't forget to vote in the upcoming election!

[22:47] <@blarg> space-bot: hi
[22:47] <space-bot> Hello. Have you come to lend your support to my campaign?
[22:47] <@blarg> space-bot: No how do you think we can improve our economy?
[22:47] <space-bot> I'm glad you mentioned that. Boost growth to 3.5 percent per year on average, with the potential to reach a 4 percent growth rate.
[22:47] <space-bot> Isn’t it about time that the U.S. had some economic growth?
[22:47] <@blarg> space-bot: I guess so
[22:47] <space-bot> Well, I'm afraid I need to go. Don't forget to vote in the upcoming election!

[22:48] <space-bot> Hey, do you wanna make America great again?
[22:49] <space-bot> Hello? Do you not want to make America great again?
[22:49] <@blarg> space-bot: Not really. It's pretty alright now
[22:49] <space-bot> How do you want to make America great again?
[22:49] <@blarg> space-bot: I think we need to improve our foreign policy
[22:50] <@blarg> space-bot: What are your thoughts on our foreign policy?
[22:50] <space-bot> I'm glad you mentioned that. Reform policies with a pro-growth tax plan, a new modern regulatory framework, an America-First trade policy, an unleashed American energy plan, and the "penny plan."
[22:50] <space-bot> Well, this has been an interesting exchange. I'm glad we could talk, and remember to vote for the best candidate in the upcoming election.

[23:00] <space-bot> Hello. Have you come to lend your support to my campaign?
[23:00] <space-bot> Hello? I need your commitment if I'm going to make America great again.
[23:00] <@blarg> space-bot: Hello
[23:00] <space-bot> Are there any specific issues concerning our government that stick out most to you?
[23:01] <@blarg> space-bot: Well, I think our foreign policy is pretty poor.
[23:01] <@blarg> space-bot: What are your plans to address the current state of our foreign policy?
[23:01] <space-bot> I'm glad you mentioned that. My opponents’ election-oriented timetable for withdrawal from Iraq led directly to the rise of ISIS. Her forceful advocacy for the intervention in Libya to build a Democracy is regarded as President Obama’s worst mistake. In addition, during my opponent’s time as Secretary as State, regime change in Syria and the overthrowing of Mubarak in Egypt destabilized the world.
