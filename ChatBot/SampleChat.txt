[22:23] <space-bot> Hello. Have you come to lend your support to my campaign?
[22:23] <@me> space-bot: Hello. No
[22:23] <space-bot> Do you think that we care well enough about our veterans?
[22:23] <@me> space-bot: Nope
[22:24] <@me> space-bot: Do you think we care about our veterans?
[22:24] <space-bot> Well, I'm glad you mentioned that. I want to ensure that our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. No more long drives. No more waiting backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support they earned with their service to our country.
[22:24] <space-bot> Well, I'm afraid I need to go. Don't forget to vote in the upcoming election!
